**Determine the sectioning angles**
-----------------------------------
Next, adjust the angles of the atlas slice to match the angles of
sectioning. Even the best sectioning routines can induce small
deviations from the vertical and horizontal planes.
Furthermore, those angles can vary in a whole series, especially if
the tissue was cut into two separate blocks. The cutting angles of
the atlas should be adjusted to match the mediolateral and
dorsoventral angles of the sections. This is done in the horizontal
and sagittal navigation windows, respectively. Use either the
rotation buttons (1) or rotation handles (2) to tilt the MRI
template in the direction needed. Adjust the anteroposterior
position to compensate for the rotation.

The angles of the current atlas slice relative to the default atlas
plane can be read out in the boxes shown above, corresponding to the
sagittal (1) and horizontal (2) navigation windows.

In coronal sections, the dorsoventral angle can be determined by
examining the relationship between landmarks in dorsal and ventral parts
of a section, e.g. between the corpus callosum and anterior commissure,
between the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, or between the pons and
inferior colliculus. The mediolateral angle can be determined by
comparing landmark structures across hemispheres. It is most easily
found by examining the development of the corpus callosum, anterior
striatum, anterior commissure, anterior hippocampus, or size differences
of the cortex in the posterior part of the brain.

**Note**: the results might look similar with angles that deviate 180
degrees (corresponding to looking at the animal from the back or from
the front). To ease the curation process, however, we recommend using
the smallest angle possible.
